         <div class="main-content">
         <p>Being a web developer can only be achieved when there is self-determination. Someone that is self-determined, will end up achieving his dream or ambition.</p>
         <p>In the Journey of becoming a web developer, there will certainly be a lot of set backs and hinches, but when your self-determined you achieve your dream. </p>
         <p>I've been in a situation where after working on a project for weeks and finished the work, I took some time off and never really went back to it for a while, till the day i was to Demo the project.</p>
         <p>Wow , that day I was so disappointed and frustrated. Unfortunately, I opened the file on my browser and everything was blank, I tried debugging the code, but maybe because I was tensed up I couldn't.</p>
         <p>When I got home, I had a nap and went back to it, and then I discovered that I didn't close one of my tags, and that's why everything went blank.</p>
         <p>You can guess the expression on my face. So guys, you have got to get a drive, you have got to be self-determined if you want that dream to be realized.</p> 
         <p>Determination is the quality that makes you continue trying to do something even when this is difficult, fierce/grim/dogged.</p> 
         <p>Self-determination according to google is defined as a process by which a person controls their own life.</p> 
         <p>So guys, be determined.</p>
